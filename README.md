# Event Manager MERN Project

## About the Project

The **Event Manager MERN Project** is a full-stack application designed to simplify the management of events for organizers and attendees. Users can **create, manage, and register for events** through an intuitive interface. The backend provides a robust RESTful API for handling event data, while the frontend offers a **responsive and interactive experience** using React.

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, including:

- Structuring a Node.js and Express backend
- Connecting and querying a MongoDB database
- Building a dynamic React frontend
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Deploying a full-stack project on modern cloud platforms (Render and Vercel)

## Why I Chose This Project

1. **Practical Application:** Event management is widely used in real life—from conferences to social gatherings. This project allowed me to create something that has tangible use.  

2. **Full-Stack Exposure:** I wanted to **combine backend and frontend skills** into one cohesive project. This includes integrating a database, API, and UI into a complete application.  

3. **Deployment Experience:** The project gave me hands-on experience deploying both backend and frontend services on cloud platforms, which is crucial for real-world software development.  

4. **Learning and Growth:** Choosing this project challenged me to **think about architecture, data flow, user experience, and security**, which strengthened my overall development skills.
